# Ping-Pong-Game

# Technologies Used:
This project was built using the following technologies:

HTML: Used to create the structure and layout of the game.
CSS: Used to style the game elements and create animations.
JavaScript: Used to implement the game logic and functionality.

# Game Rule:
The game is played between two players, each controlling a paddle on opposite sides of the screen. The objective is to hit the ball back and forth across the net and score points by making the ball go past the opponent's paddle.

The game starts with the ball in the center of the screen, and a player serves the ball by hitting it with their paddle. The ball must bounce once on the opponent's side of the screen before they can hit it back.
